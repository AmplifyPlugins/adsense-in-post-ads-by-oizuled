Easily publish a page or post, and schedule certain content to be displayed at a later date or time.

== Description ==
If you need to publish a page or a post, but want to keep some of the content hidden until a later date or time, this plugin will help you.

This plugin is used with an easy to configure shortcode that lets you set a start date and time, as well as an end date and time. The end date and time is especially useful for expiring content on the same page.

For contest organizers, you may want to post a page with information about the winner of your contest. However, if you are announcing the winner's name at a live event, you may not want to publish this publicly until after the live announcement has been made. 

You can write a post with general information about the contest, and when the winner will be announced. You can then include information about the winner in the same post, but have it hidden until you are ready to show it. The general information can be set to expire at the same time as the winner is announced if desired.

This plugin also accepts other shortcodes, which allows for galleries and tons of other schedulable content.
